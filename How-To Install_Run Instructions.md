# How to Run

-It will be run through Android Stdio using the emulator feature and we might eventually publish the app on Android app store so the users can download it.

# How to Test

There are two ways to test our code using a real device or emulator on a laptop. 

In order to run on a real Android device, it has to be enabled for development. For a device running a recent version of Android 9.0+, first, connect the device to a laptop with a USB cable. Then, open the “Settings” screen on the Android device and select “About phone.” Scroll to the bottom and tap “Build number” seven times, until “You are now a developer!” Is visible. Then, return to the previous screen, and select “System.” After that, select “Advanced,” scroll to the bottom, and tap “Developer options.” In the “Developer options” window, scroll down to find and enable “USB debugging.”

The next step is to run our app on the device. In the Android Studio toolbar, select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu. From the “target device” drop-down menu, select the device that you desire to run our app on. Then, select “Run” and this will launch our app on the connected device. 

In order to run our app on the Android Emulator, find the “Android Studio toolbar” and select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu.
