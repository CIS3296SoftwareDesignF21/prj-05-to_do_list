Description: 
- First we will start off by having the user log in by entering the user name and the password and if they don't have an account they will click on the sign up button, that will take them to a separate sign up page where they fill out their sign up info. After passing successfully the sign in page, they will go to the main page where it has the 4 modules( Grocery list, School list, Workout list, and Collaborative list) to choose from. Then after choosing what list you want to add your task into, you will go to the ToDoList page where you add/remove the task under page.
