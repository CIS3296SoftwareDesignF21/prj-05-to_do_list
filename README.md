# How to Install

- Android Stdio is what we are going to use as our IDE and it's going to be done in Java Programming since everyone is familiar with the language.

# How to Run

-It will be run through Android Stdio using the emulator feature and we might eventually publish the app on Android app store so the users can download it.

# How to Test

There are two ways to test our code using a real device or emulator on a laptop. 

In order to run on a real Android device, it has to be enabled for development. For a device running a recent version of Android 9.0+, first, connect the device to a laptop with a USB cable. Then, open the “Settings” screen on the Android device and select “About phone.” Scroll to the bottom and tap “Build number” seven times, until “You are now a developer!” Is visible. Then, return to the previous screen, and select “System.” After that, select “Advanced,” scroll to the bottom, and tap “Developer options.” In the “Developer options” window, scroll down to find and enable “USB debugging.”

The next step is to run our app on the device. In the Android Studio toolbar, select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu. From the “target device” drop-down menu, select the device that you desire to run our app on. Then, select “Run” and this will launch our app on the connected device. 

In order to run our app on the Android Emulator, find the “Android Studio toolbar” and select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu.

### Alex a college student studying Business Administration (Dom Arishi) 

Alex is 18 years old, he is a first- year student studying Business Administration at Fox School at Temple University main campus. Alex has tried many times to work as a full time before deciding going to school in Alentown where his parents live, but unfortuanlty he couldn't find something with decent salary so as a result he decided to pursue his bachelor degree. He spends most of his time procrastinating from studying and forgetting running his important errands due to his bad habit of disorganization and as a result of that he missed a lot of assignments and his grade has significantly been decresing. So Alex is interested in using a To_Do_List app to help him get his life back together and hopefully improve his grade and organize his daily task/errands to make his day more productive.

### Natalie a senior biomedical engineering student (Yara Alzhrani)

Natalie, age 22, is a senior biomedical engineering student at Drexel University, working at a company far away from the city which costs her so much time to commute between her job and classes, also she has a side project that she is working on with her friends, which require them alot time and effort as well. They want to make it fully successful by the end of 2022. But the worst side is that she got very busy working for her internship to gain experience and working on her personal project to help in improving their project as soon as they could, despite the fact that both matters were beneficial in her career, but she was greatly preoccupied with things other than her school work, which is the main goal, that led to a decrease her GPA way more than what she expected. That's why she decided to be more organized and find the right balance between work and study. She needed to use the To_Do_List application in order to be on track with her studies, internship, and any other personal tasks. Her notebook wasn't accessible everywhere, and that's why using the app give her the ability to keep track of her progress with her daily tasks even while commuting.

### Andrew the family slacker (Abe Javed)

Andrew, age 18 in a family of 5 with two older siblings which are much more organized than he is. Their parents' anniversary is coming up and the children wanted to set up a party and trip for their parents to get way and enjoy themselves now that they are all adults and don't need supervision. The three kids made a plan to delegate each aspect of the planning and booking of all the events. They would each work and put aside a set amount of money to help fund this trip for their parents. Both of Andrew's siblings knew that he wouldn't be able to remember or be able to stick to the schedule they have made together. So the oldest sibling took his phone and downloaded To_Do_List.io to help him out. This way they could all keep track of his progress and he would get notifications of milestones he would have needed to completed at a certain day before the actual booking time of the trip and the checklist for all the items he needed to buy for the party they were throwing. As time went on, Andrew noticed a sense of responsibility that he never had before and he became much more organized with the help of the app.
