# How to Install

- Android Stdio is what we are going to use as our IDE and it's going to be done in Java Programming since everyone is familiar with the language.

# How to Run

-It will be run through Android Stdio using the emulator feature and we might eventually publish the app on Android app store so the users can download it.

# How to Test

There are two ways to test our code using a real device or emulator on a laptop. 

In order to run on a real Android device, it has to be enabled for development. For a device running a recent version of Android 9.0+, first, connect the device to a laptop with a USB cable. Then, open the “Settings” screen on the Android device and select “About phone.” Scroll to the bottom and tap “Build number” seven times, until “You are now a developer!” Is visible. Then, return to the previous screen, and select “System.” After that, select “Advanced,” scroll to the bottom, and tap “Developer options.” In the “Developer options” window, scroll down to find and enable “USB debugging.”

The next step is to run our app on the device. In the Android Studio toolbar, select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu. From the “target device” drop-down menu, select the device that you desire to run our app on. Then, select “Run” and this will launch our app on the connected device. 

In order to run our app on the Android Emulator, find the “Android Studio toolbar” and select our app from the “run configurations” drop-down menu.

## Personas

### Alex a college student studying Business Administration (Dom Arishi) 

Alex is 18 years old, he is a first- year student studying Business Administration at Fox School at Temple University main campus. Alex has tried many times to work as a full time before deciding going to school in Alentown where his parents live, but unfortuanlty he couldn't find something with decent salary so as a result he decided to pursue his bachelor degree. He spends most of his time procrastinating from studying and forgetting running his important errands due to his bad habit of disorganization and as a result of that he missed a lot of assignments and his grade has significantly been decresing. So Alex is interested in using a To_Do_List app to help him get his life back together and hopefully improve his grade and organize his daily task/errands to make his day more productive.

After passing successfully the sign in page, they will go to the main page where it has the 4 modules( Grocery list, School list, Workout list, and Collaborative list) to choose from. Then after choosing what list you want to add your task into, you will go to the ToDoList page where you add/remove the task under page.
