# Project 

To_Do_List APP!

- The project is basically going to be for our disorganized friends who needs your help in tracking down their daily tasks. It will allow the user to write, origanize and reprioritize the user's task more efficiently.


# How to Install

- Android Stdio is what we are going to use as our IDE and it's going to be done in Java Programming since everyone is familiar with the language.

# How to Run

-It will be run through Android Stdio using the emulator feature and we might eventually publish the app on Android app store so the users can download it.


## Feedback/Additions/

- Possible addition: collaborative list-making. Ex Family grocery list where each memeber can add what they want

## Personas
- High school and higher education students who have many assignments due with varying diffuculty and time required
- Parents who need to make a chore list for their younger kids that needs to be updated as it goes along
- Busniess owners who need to delegate tasks to their workers for a singular project or job
- People who have chaotic days and are looking for a way to organize their days


## Vision Statment

- For student users who face difficulties organizing their tasks, To_Do_List App is a mobile application that allows users to label tasks, customize through color codes, and add due dates to highlight task status with checklists to keep track of the tasks. Unlike Week Plan on App Store, our product will have a simple but eye-catching and aesthetically pleasing UI with a short learning curve that can help the users to access a wide range of modules.
