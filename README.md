Alex is 18 years old, he is a first- year student studying Business Administration at Fox School at Temple University main campus. Alex has tried many times to work as a full time before deciding going to school in Alentown where his parents live, but unfortuanlty he couldn't find something with decent salary so as a result he decided to pursue his bachelor degree. He spends most of his time procrastinating from studying and forgetting running his important errands due to his bad habit of disorganization and as a result of that he missed a lot of assignments and his grade has significantly been decresing. So Alex is interested in using a To_Do_List app to help him get his life back together and hopefully improve his grade and organize his daily task/errands to make his day more productive.
