## Andrew the family slacker (Abe Javed)

Andrew, age 18 in a family of 5 with two older siblings which are much more organized than he is. Their parents' anniversary is coming up and the children wanted to set up a party and trip for their parents to get way and enjoy themselves now that they are all adults and don't need supervision. The three kids made a plan to delegate each aspect of the planning and booking of all the events. They would each work and put aside a set amount of money to help fund this trip for their parents. Both of Andrew's siblings knew that he wouldn't be able to remember or be able to stick to the schedule they have made together. So the oldest sibling took his phone and downloaded To_Do_List.io to help him out. This way they could all keep track of his progress and he would get notifications of milestones he would have needed to completed at a certain day before the actual booking time of the trip and the checklist for all the items he needed to buy for the party they were throwing. As time went on, Andrew noticed a sense of responsibility that he never had before and he became much more organized with the help of the app.
